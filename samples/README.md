# Sample Emails

This folder contains **phishing sample `.eml` files** intended for local/demo use with **PhishNet**.

- Treat these as **malicious**.
- Do not open links or attachments outside of a sandbox.
- PhishNet will display the original email **as text-only**, defang URLs, and use **screenshot-only** rendering in Open Safely.
